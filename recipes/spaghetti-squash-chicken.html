<h2 class="imagecaption">This is the Spaghetti Squash Chicken Parm that my ex-girlfriend used to make all the time!
    <p>She gave me the recipe before I moved to another city beacuse I loved it that much. It really is a great dish to show off to friends or family or a date. 
        But it is still easy to make and not that long of a process once you do it once or twice!
